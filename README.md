## Task 1: 3D Printing
### OBJECTIVE
The main objective of this task was to learn and get hands on experience with 3D printers. The baiscs of STL file and slicing of STL file. Understanding about bed tempresture, infill density, Extruder temperature, Flow control etc. was achieved. Later creating a STL file and getting it 3D printed.   
### PROCEDURE
To begin with the basic understanding of a 3D printer I used resources provided and understood what 3D printer is and how does it work. I also referred some other websites to understand about PLA setting and STL files. Basically STL file stands for Stereolithography and is the most common file used in 3D prinitng. STL represents the 3D model created in a mesh format made with small triangles. Slicing of stl file means to convert it to machine language where the 3D printer understands the instructions. Also understood the standard operating procedure to work with 3D printers and precautionary steps to be kept in mind before starting to printing. 

Parameters and its settings 

**PARAMETERS**

Bed Temperature 50-60°C

Extruder temprature 200°C

Fan Control >15secs

Infill Density 20%

Also Created a 3D model by my own and saved it in .stl format to further print it. 
### LEARNING 
Understood Basic terms of a 3d Printer. Designed a model for 3D printing and gained knowledge on how to execute the model to print. And also got to see different types of 3D printers in the Lab.
