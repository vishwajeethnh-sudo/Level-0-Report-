# Task 12: Soldering Prequirities 
## Objective
To understand the working and purpose of soldering equipment available in the lab, including soldering iron, solder wire, soldering wick, and flux. 
To learn proper soldering techniques and safety practices. To assemble and solder a basic LED circuit on a perf board under the supervision of a coordinator.

## Procedure
The following tools and materials were studied:

Soldering iron – Used to heat components and melt solder.

Solder wire – Alloy used to create electrical and mechanical joints.

Flux – Improves solder flow and removes oxidation.

Soldering wick – Used for removing excess solder (desoldering).

Perf board – Board with holes for mounting components.
### Parameters 
Parameter	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Leaded Solder	|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lead-Free Solder

Composition &nbsp; &nbsp; 	Tin (Sn) + Lead (Pb) |&nbsp; &nbsp; Tin (Sn) + Silver (Ag) + Copper (Cu)
                                                 
Common Ratio	&nbsp; &nbsp; Sn63/Pb37 |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; Sn99/Ag0.3/Cu0.7 (varies) 

Melting Point	&nbsp; &nbsp; 183°C	|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 217–220°C

Ideal Tip Temperature	&nbsp; &nbsp; 320–350°C	|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 350–380°C

## Learning
Understood the purpose and safe handling of soldering equipment, learned correct soldering technique (heat joint first, then apply solder), identified good vs. poor solder joints, gained hands-on experience assembling LEDs on a perf board,developed confidence in performing basic electronic hardware assembly.
