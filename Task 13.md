# Task 13: 555 Astable 
## Objective
To design a 555 timer in astable mode with a duty cycle of 60%,to implement the circuit on a breadboard, to observe and analyze the output waveform using a Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO).
## Procedure
A 555 timer IC was configured in astable mode to generate a continuous square wave output with a duty cycle of approximately 60%. I studied the working of the 555 timer in astable operation, where it switches continuously between HIGH and LOW states without external triggering. Resistors and a capacitor were connected according to the standard astable configuration. I calculated the time period and frequency using the required formulas before assembling the circuit. Minor wiring mistakes were corrected while verifying the output waveform. 

The circuit consisting of 555 timer IC, 2 resistors, capacitor, breadboard, jumperwires, Power supply and DSO was made using the recources provided and the power supply was given, few adjustments in frequency and Amplification was done to get the required output. 

## Learning
Understood the working principle of 555 timer in astable mode, learned how resistor and capacitor values affect frequency and duty cycle, gained hands-on experience with breadboard circuit assembly, learned correct usage of DSO probes and waveform measurement, understood practical deviations between theoretical and measured values due to component tolerances.
