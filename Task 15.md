# Task 5: Linear regression
## Objective
To understand the mathematical foundation of Linear Regression by implementing it from scratch using Gradient Descent, and to compare its performance with the sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression implementation on the California Housing dataset using standard regression metrics.

## Procedure
Loaded the California Housing datasets, selected input features (X) and target variable (y), split the dataset into training and testing sets, applied feature scaling (standardization) to the input features to ensure faster and stable convergence during gradient descent.

Implementing Linear Regression from scratch. Starting with Model representation by using Hypothesis function, Loss Function and gradient descent optimization. 

After that trained the model using scikit learn. Evaluated the model, visualized it and compared the performance data 

## Learning
Understanding Optimization, importance of Feature Scaling, Learning Rate Sensitivity, Model Evaluation and got a practical insight of how machine learning impacts.
