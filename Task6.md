#Task 6: Matrix Puzzle
## Objective:
To get hands on experience with **NumPy** and **Matlab**. Using these solve a matrix puzzle and decode it to reveal the image.
## Procedure:
Dowloaded the Given image and Opened Google Colab. Before that understood what is Numpy and MATLAB. NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental Python library used for numerical computing and mathematical operations, especially when working with arrays and matrices. MATLAB (short for Matrix Laboratory) is a high-level programming language and computing environment used for numerical computation, simulation, modeling, and visualization.

After this I began with inserting the image to the code. Then I gave dimensions for it to determine the size. After this I reshaped the matrix. Then to get a correct image, made modifications and Ran the code. At last Visualized it by using Matplotlib and the correct image was found to be a smiley face. 
## Learning 
This task helped me gain knowledge on what is **NumPy** and **MATLAB**. Worked with it to gain experience. And also learnt about the commands of coding with python.
