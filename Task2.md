# TASK 2: API
## Objective
In this task we got to know what is an API. Working of an API and its applications. Understanding it and applying to a real world based project
## Procedure 
I started the task with understanding Application Programming Interface(API). API is basically a intermediate between software systems and helps connect them seamlessly. These are used in collecting data from software to another software . For example websites like goibibo and makemytrip use the API of airline websites like Indigo, AirIndia and show all the ticket price in their own website.

To execute this in a different problem I made a Weahter API to showcase weather of different cities in one website. And also modified the code to enter the City and get their weather info in the same website. To get the info I used the **OpenWeather API** website.
## Learning
This task helped me understand what API is and how it makes the use of apps seamless. This task also helped me with basics of HTML and Javascript. Helped me get familiar with Visual Studio Code.
