# Task 9: TinkerCad
## Objective
To get introduction to TinkerCAD and its application. Checking out the example circuits given and Simulate them. Also construct a circuit to estimate the Distance of an obstacle using a sensor. Displaying the results on a serial Monitor. 
## Procedure 
Made an account on the TinkerCad website to create and explore circuits. Ultrasonic sensor emits sound waves and the time it takes to bounce back is used to calculate the distance. The use of Servo motor is to rotate the ultrasonic sensor so that wide range of area can be covered to detect the object.

Started up with building a Radar System using ultrasonic sensor, servo motor and jumper wires to connect them to serial monitor to showcase the distance. Used the referance link to make connections and simulate. Connected all of them in such a manner that ultrasonic sensor can detect the object and distance can be calculated. 
## Learning 
I learnt what a tinkercad is and what are its applications. Got a hands on experience of using the application. Made a simple circuit to detect an object which helped me to understand it better.
