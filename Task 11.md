# Task 11: LED Toggle using ESP32
## Objcetive
Understand the working and architecture of the ESP32 microcontroller. Configure the Arduino IDE to program an ESP32 board. Develop a standalone web server hosted on the ESP32 which controls an LEDs connected to ESP32 GPIO pins. 
## Procedure
Working of ESP32

ESP32 is a low-cost, low-power microcontroller with built in WiFi, Bluetooth and has a Dual-core processor, it consists of Multiple GPIO pins, it also supports ADC, DAC, PWM. It can be used as a wifi station and a standalone webserver. 

To start with go to Arduino IDE and configure it for ESP32. Make the connections using ESP32 and LEDs and Jumperwire. Write a code to insert it into ESP32 so that it can act as a wifi staion and provide switch On/OFF buutons. Upload this code to ESP32 using USB cable and slect the right COM port and run it. Copy the webpage address to control switching ON/Off.
## Learning 
This task helped in understanding ESP32 architecture and capabilities, WiFi based communication, GPIO control via web interface, Configuring Arduino IDE for new boards.
